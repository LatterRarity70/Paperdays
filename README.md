## Paperdays

A prototype mod that turns Geometry Dash into another game using the Geode SDK! 

This thing is inspired by such great games as OMORI and UNDERTALE. 

Help a 13-year-old girl named Susie relive these vivid, blinding memories and decide if she is worthy of life. 

Almost entire visual drawn using mouse, basicly having white on black.
